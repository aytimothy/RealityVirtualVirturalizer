# Component List

The following is a list of components required to complete this project. Estimates are provided in AUD.
For some components, alternative models may also work.

* [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.amazon.com.au/Raspberry-Pi-4-2GB-RAM/dp/B07TD42S27/ref=sr_1_6?crid=184PMG8I4IONV&keywords=raspberry+pi+4+4gb&qid=1587800170&s=computers&sprefix=raspberr%2Ccomputers%2C315&sr=1-6) ($89)
* [Arduino Uno](https://www.amazon.com.au/Arduino-A000066-ARDUINO-UNO-R3/dp/B008GRTSV6) ($44)
* [USB Webcam](https://www.amazon.com.au/1080P-Autofocus-Webcam-Camera-Resolving/dp/B08737LV2K?ref_=s9_apbd_oup_hd_bw_b5MWAfL&pf_rd_r=2A036W5905HXZWZKBSD0&pf_rd_p=97662576-cbf4-57a2-a556-6c915736e068&pf_rd_s=merchandised-search-10&pf_rd_t=BROWSE&pf_rd_i=4913411051)($13)
* [5V Battery Pack](https://core-electronics.com.au/usb-battery-pack-2200-mah-capacity-5v-1a-output.html) ($31)
* [MPU 9250 IMU](https://core-electronics.com.au/sparkfun-imu-breakout-mpu-9250.html) ($23)
* [Fan](https://core-electronics.com.au/miniature-5v-cooling-fan-for-raspberry-pi-and-other-computers.html?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=CjwKCAjwv4_1BRAhEiwAtMDLsnEP0o9JB3dVg6mXlFmkfR6-CI7wFBw4nG5uqDWiB_QEqay00FXDeBoCsYAQAvD_BwE)($8)
* [Hokuyo UTM-30LX Lidar](https://www.robotshop.com/en/hokuyo-utm-03lx-laser-scanning-rangefinder.html)($7000)
* [3D Printer](https://www.amazon.com.au/Comgrow-Creality-Ender-Aluminum-220x220x250mm/dp/B07BR3F9N6/ref=asc_df_B07BR3F9N6/?tag=googleshopdsk-22&linkCode=df0&hvadid=341772799570&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11305869294912506949&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9069275&hvtargid=pla-452985168135&psc=1)($400)

**Estimated Total = ~$7600**

A suitable replacement for the Lidar is:

* [Mapping Sensor](https://core-electronics.com.au/slamtec-mapper-m1m1-360-laser-mapping-sensor-tof-20m.html?utm_source=google_shopping&gclid=CjwKCAjwv4_1BRAhEiwAtMDLslmyMLtp9HueBQvOihmjIKKT8ObRMxG8sU-rGKH1RQgaho2MKJS6XhoCuiAQAvD_BwE), which cuts out the use of a Hokuyo and cuts the cost by at least $6000, down to about $1500.

**Note:** For this project, a higher end Lidar device was used. Obviously this has driven the price of the project up. But this project would also work with cheaper Lidar devices with some driver tweaking.
