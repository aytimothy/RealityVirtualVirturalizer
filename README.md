# Reality Virtual Virtualizer

Reality Virtual Virtualizer is an attempt at creating a LIDAR-based solution for mapping the spatial world for use in a virtual environment. It is done as a student project for Work Integrated Learning at Griffith University by Team Reality Virtual Virtualizer (yeah, very original name).

The aim is put together a product that would allow you to scan the world with the aim of using as much off-the-shelf and budget components as possible.

## Project Structure

* `arduino` - This is where all Arduino code goes, part of the scanner.
* `bill-of-materials` - This is the bill of materials required to create this.
* `build-instructions` - This is where you'll find the instructions for creating this on your own. **START HERE FIRST!!!**
* `case-design` - This is where you'll find the holder for all the components.
* `catkin_ws` - This is where all the ROS code goes, part of the scanner.
* `docs` - Documentation (may be moved to repository wiki)
* `promo` - This is where you can find all promotional material created for this project.
* `src` - This is where you'll find the source code for the computer application that will perform reconstruction.
* `web` - This is the web interface for the scanner.

## Getting Started

See the `README.md` located in `/build-instructions` to get you started.
