The following are the steps required to assemble the physical scanning device.
This is assuming that all the [necessary parts](https://github.com/aytimothy/RealityVirtualVirturalizer/blob/master/bill-of-materials/README.md) have been acquired.

These instructions should be used alongside the software installation guide which can be found [here](https://github.com/aytimothy/RealityVirtualVirturalizer/blob/master/docs/Installation.md).

# Printing The Case

A case has been designed which will house all of the components for the device.

The STL files for these parts can be found [here](https://github.com/aytimothy/RealityVirtualVirturalizer/tree/master/case-design).
