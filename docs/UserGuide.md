This document will tell you how to capture your environment. It should be quite simple to use.

# 1. Build/Setup Device <a name="build"></a>


First, follow the instructions in [`/docs/Installation.md`](https://github.com/aytimothy/RealityVirtualVirturalizer/blob/master/docs/Installation.md) to build and run the machine.

Next, ensure it is connected to your Wi-Fi Network. 
Once the device has been configured correctly, use either of the following applications:
  1. Desktop application: Open the desktop application
  2. Web application: Open a web browser at `localhost:8080`.


# 2. Desktop UI <a name="desktop"></a>

# 3. Web UI <a name="web"></a>
The web version has been designed to be a lightweight interface which performs most of the actions that the desktop version can.

Instructions about how to use the web application can be found [here](https://github.com/Jimson91/-RealityVirtualVirturalizer-Interface/wiki).
